#+TITLE: Simple Keyboard Remapper

This project is modified/simplified from The [[https://github.com/pietroiusti/janus-key][Janus Key]] project.

Some features (which are unnecessary for a Emacs users) are removed to keep the
code super simple.


* Introduction

This program will create a new virtual keyboard device (with `uinput') and
rebuilding the events in this virtual device while blocking the original
keyboard events.


* Installation

This will build, install, enable and start the service.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make install
#+END_SRC

To stop the service and uninstall the program:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make uninstall
#+END_SRC

You may need to change the device name in [[file:simple-keyboard-remapper.service::\[Unit\]][the systemd service file]].


* Debug

You can read the log of the service with this command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo journalctl -u simple-keyboard-remapper -f
#+END_SRC
