#+TITLE: Simple Keyboard Remapper

This project is modified/simplified from The [[https://github.com/pietroiusti/janus-key][Janus Key]] project.

Some features are removed to keep the code super simple.


* Introduction

This program is based on `uinput'.  We create a new virtual keyboard device
(with `uinput') and rebuilding the events in this virtual device while blocking
the original keyboard events.


* Installation

This will build, install, enable and start the service.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make install
#+END_SRC

To stop the service and uninstall the program:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make uninstall
#+END_SRC


* Debug

You can read the log of the service with this command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo journalctl -u simple-keyboard-remapper -f
#+END_SRC
